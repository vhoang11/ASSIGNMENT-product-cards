      <h2 class="card-title">Henry</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Meet sweet Henry, he is a 3 month old mixed pup looking for his forever home. Henry is a very sweet boy, he needs time to warm up to his people, he is shy. He tends to migrate to women faster than men. Henry is good with all. He prefers to hang out in his yard and over look his palace, or on the sofa. He is house trained and crate trained. His favorite pastimes are snuggling with his humans, playing with toys, and going for car rides, not necessarily in that order. He is great on a leash and ready to go for a walk with you today!</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Hanalei</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Hanalei is a 2-year-old 15 lb mix. This little nugget is very chill, low energy, LOVES kids, and is good with dogs. Her favorite person in the whole wide world is her 8 yo, human foster brother. We have not cat-tested her. Hanalei absolutely loves toys and has a habit of collecting them in her crate. She also loves to play fetch. She would be the perfect family dog for honestly any family. As she is young, loving, and smaller (ie, she can’t get into trouble on the kitchen counters), she’d make a great first dog if you’re ready to take that step!</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Gizmo</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Who loves a naughty puppy with crazy eyes??? Then I have the girl for you! Gizmo, is a 12 week old wild alligator mix. Maybe a little velociraptor? Hard to say at this age. But we think she is a birding dog /aussie mix of sorts. We are still working on biting toys, not people, walking nicely on a leash, and not gutting all the toys. What we do well, cuddling when she’s sleepy, stop biting when told No, sleeping all night in our crate, finding sticks and pinecones on our walks, and understanding that cats aren’t chew toys and will absolutely kick your ass.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Horatio</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Arrow is a 3 year old, 10 pound terrier mix who came in with a friend. The two of them were left in the woods and were found emaciated. Arrow is a social, happy dog who loves everyone. He is good with people, dogs and cats and would probably rescue baby raccoons if they were in front of him. He is high energy and loves to go for runs. He would do equally well in a home with a serious runner or a family with a fenced yard and a dog friend for him to play with. </p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Urie</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Urie is a 3-month-old Border Collie/Cur. Mom is a Border Collie and we don’t know who dad is since he was a traveling salesman so we’re guessing. She is a puppy who will do puppy things like chew your favorite charging cord and laptop plugs. Be prepared to puppy-proof your home and spend some time training her to be the very best she can be as an adult. Urie is good with everyone and everything and can go to any home that is a good fit for her puppy antics.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Westin</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Westin is a 6 month old mix who is ready to find her forever home. She is a very intelligent and sweet girl. She knows how to sit, shake, speak, and lay down – I’m sure she would love for you to teach her more! She loves her people (including kids!), is good on leash, and would coexist in a home with a calm dog. She is generally well mannered and learns quickly. She would be best in a teenaged and up home with no small children.</p>
